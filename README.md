# 4-digit-hex-password-protected-lock-system (Developed Feb-Apr 2k19)

The project was aiming to password protect any system using basic digital ICs. The circuit was Self-designed & optimized from scratch (gate level circuit) to provide 50,625 unique combinations of resettable passwords. Even though the whole circuit is designed from scratch (gate level), its having very interesting features like, The burglar alarm will be activated after 3 wrong attempts and stops only after entering the right password.

During the circuit design 2 different optimization has been performed and it has reduced drastic number of required Transister. After successfully completed the circuit design the design has been successfully tested on Altera Quartus simulator and Altera DE-1 FPGA Development Kit.
